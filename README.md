# Cash&nbsp;Flow<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> <br>
To automate a current process of generating a projected cash flow report to Accounting and Finance ( on 15th and 30th of every  month). Currently, the report has being generated via Excel by manually updating the loans that will be funded/ drawn in addition to a weekly ( Monday)  email notifying Finance/Accounting  of upcoming closings. New automated report will be very similar to Secondary Market report, generated daily.<br>

<b>Process:</b><br>
As the information was all on one Excel sheet, I found it difficult to understand and digest from a visual and manipulatable stance. I started by cleaning the data and getting it into individual pages within Excel to make them more manageable. Once this was done I created a Cash Flow project within PowerBI to find a way to manipulate the data that would allow us to see upcoming loans that would be funed/drawn given any week.
