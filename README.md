# Cash&nbsp;Flow<br>
## <b>Purpose:</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To automate a current process of generating a projected cash flow report to Accounting and Finance (on 15th and 30th of every  month). Currently, the report has being generated via Excel by manually updating the loans that will be funded/ drawn in addition to a weekly (Monday)  email notifying Finance/Accounting  of upcoming closings. New automated report will be very similar to Secondary Market report, generated daily.<br>

## <b>Process:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the information was all on one Excel sheet, I found it difficult to understand and digest from a visual and manipulatable stance. I started by cleaning the data and getting it into individual pages within Excel to make them more manageable. Once this was done I created a Cash Flow project within PowerBI to extract the date in order to manipulate it in such a way that it woudl instantaniously let us know when loans would closing based on the parameters we give it. The data that would allow us to see upcoming loans that would be funed/drawn given any year, quarter, month, and day.

## <b>Challenges</b> 
* Not knowing what the information looked like prior to the excel document - There might be opportunity to go from one report right to the next without needing to create an Excel document.
* The confines of the report are limited to a small amount of time, so the results only show a small snapshot of time.

## Report Layout
### Monthly View of Draw Amounts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monthly View Reports allows the users a stagnant view of what is projected within the upcoming months based on the given information or what has been reported.<br>

* The Date Field allows the user to identify which dates in particular they would want to identify what loans are outstanding.<br>
* The Amount Outstanding gives a glimps against the other loans how these loans affect the rest of the year.<br>
* The Rightmost gives the user the information of which loan numbers will be closing, when, and how much is outstanding in the time fram chosen by the user.
